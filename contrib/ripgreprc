# ripgrep config file, each line is its own command-line option, comments and blanks are ignored.
# Every uncommented line is treated as a single argv, no quoting needed, but this also means that
# there's no arg splitting on spaces in a single line.
# Allen Wild's ripgreprc is distributed with this package, containing the base customizations that
# I prefer. This file is used rather than changing the compiled-in defaults, because that would
# break test cases.

# default to smart case rather than case-sensitive
--smart-case

# skip gitignore processing by default, invert with --ignore-vcs
--no-ignore-vcs

# colors to mimic ag
--colors=match:fg:magenta
--colors=line:fg:yellow
--colors=path:fg:green

# type aliases
--type-add=bb:include:bitbake
--type-add=cxx:include:cpp
--type-add=patch:include:diff

# extend make type to include Makefile.*, as often seen in the Linux kernel
# (note this is a glob, not a regex)
--type-add=make:[Mm]akefile.*
